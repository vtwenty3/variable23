	<h1> Cars, Computers and Physics </h1>
	<p calss="text">It is all a game. An interesting one.
		Some would get offended if you call a racing simulator a game, but for the normal person, it's just a game.
		Asseto Corsa ("Race Setup" from Italian) is developed from Kunos Simulazioni. As it is a racing simulator it's
		the main emphasis is real-world physics and car handling. It is an attempt to offer as close to the real racing
		experience with a variety of highly detailed cars and laser scanned tracks. Tyre deformation, brakes
		temperatures, weather.. it all makes a difference, just as in the real world.</p>
	<div class="parallax-1"></div>

	<h1> Limitless Possibilities </h1>
	<p calss="text">It is a simulation. An interesting one.
		From Ferrari 250 GTO 1962 to Mercedes 190E to Lamborghini Aventador, it covers an insane amount of cars.
		Combining those with tracks all over the world, from old classics to current F1 tracks you can explore sometimes
		the
		inexorable in the real world. Despite the actual racing, sim-racing a pretty affordable and easy to start. Learn
		more bout it here.</p>

	<h1>Above the edge</h1>
	<p calss="text"> Finding the limits of each car is a dangerous hobby, but thanks to technology, you can get pretty
		close. Learning basic mechanical principles and driving techniques was never safer and easier. Experimenting
		with different car setups, track temperatures or difficult weather is an enjoyable and interesting experience.
	</p>
	<div class="parallax-3"></div>
	<h1>Create, experiment, improve</h1>
	<p calss="text"> You can take it a step further. . As a simulation it's written well and easy to modify, so the
		modding community behind it is huge. Countless freshly developed cars, tracks and scripts are constantly
		released and updated. You are not happy with something? Change it.
		The basic unmodded title have pretty boring graphics, but with some tweaks, you can make it look almost
		photorealistic, pushing the limits of any high-end pc. Texture mods, ray-tracing, local-reflections, volumetric
		headlights are just some of the additional features you can add easily.

	<h1>One more thing</h1>
	<p calss="text"> It all depends on you. You are creator of the experience. Now it's your turn. Press the start.
